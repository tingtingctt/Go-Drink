## User Story
Our app originated from a simple idea which is to create a customized mapping service that caters to each user’s preference for his/her lifestyle. The ultimate app will know all of user’s preferences among the things that enrich their personal time - like whether they prefer yoga or spinning classes, Italian cuisine or Chinese food, etc, and suggest a list of places to go around them in real time wherever they go in the world.

## Database
We used Sequelize to manage our database. There are currently 3 models: Business, User, Index. Currently, the Businesses database is prepopulated with Mysql schema. The Users table saves the user login information, and the Businesses table logs businesses name, location, longitude and latitude and the category of business for the user preference (for example: nightclubs, jazz bars, beer gardens, sports bars, cocktail lounges). 


## Future Development
Use Google Locations API to populate our database
Save feature where users can store favorite locations
